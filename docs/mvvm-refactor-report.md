# MVVM Refactor Execution Report

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 3 (Budget Panel) Complete

## Timeline Snapshot
- **Phase 1 – Foundation:** ViewModel contracts and base infrastructure. *(Completed Oct 19)*
- **Phase 2 – MyAccountsPanel:** First MVVM migration plus regression harness. *(Completed Oct 19)*
- **Phase 3 – MyBudgetPanel:** Budget workflow migrated to MVVM with supporting tests. *(Completed Oct 20)*

## Work Completed

### 1. ViewModel Foundation
Created the reusable scaffolding for future ViewModels:

- **`ViewModel.java`** — Interface defining listener registration and lifecycle (`dispose`).
- **`ObservableViewModel.java`** — Shared implementation using `PropertyChangeSupport` for observable state.

These live in `src/org/homeunix/thecave/buddi/viewmodel/` and are reused by every subsequent ViewModel.

### 2. MyAccountsPanel Migration
- Added **`MyAccountsViewModel.java`** to encapsulate account tree logic, net worth computation, and selection helpers.
- Refactored **`MyAccountsPanel.java`** to delegate all model access and state mutations to the ViewModel while retaining Swing wiring only.
- Property changes (`PROPERTY_NET_WORTH_TEXT`, `PROPERTY_ACCOUNT_TREE_CHANGED`) keep the UI in sync without manual refresh calls.

### 3. MyBudgetPanel Migration
- Introduced **`MyBudgetViewModel.java`** managing budget period selection, tree expansion persistence, and net income formatting.
- Updated **`MyBudgetPanel.java`** to:
   - Subscribe to ViewModel property changes for spinner, combobox, and label updates.
   - Route period/date actions through new ViewModel commands with event-guard helpers.
   - Remove direct `Document` access and rely solely on ViewModel APIs.
- Added guard logic (`suppressSpinnerChange`, `suppressPeriodTypeChange`) so programmatic updates do not trigger duplicate events or EDT recursion.

### 4. Regression Coverage (Manual Harness)
- **`MyAccountsViewModelTest.java`** (9 assertions) continues to verify net worth formatting, selection helpers, listener lifecycle, and expansion persistence.
- **`MyBudgetViewModelTest.java`** (4 assertions) now validates period-type notifications, date persistence, and net income aggregation.
- Both suites run as manual main methods in `junit/org/homeunix/thecave/buddi/test/viewmodel/`, keeping dependencies Swing-free.

```
Manual Regression Summary
-------------------------
MyAccountsViewModelTest : 9/9 assertions passing
MyBudgetViewModelTest   : 4/4 assertions passing
```

## Key Improvements
- **Repeatable MVVM Pattern:** Budget screens now share the same ViewModel contract as accounts, proving the architecture scales beyond the pilot.
- **Cleaner Views:** Panels are reduced to Swing-specific responsibilities (rendering, event wiring), making future UI tweaks safer.
- **Observable State Model:** Property names (`netIncomeText`, `budgetTreeChanged`, etc.) standardise how views subscribe to updates.
- **Testing Hooks:** Manual regression suites provide immediate feedback without spinning up Swing, and can be ported to JUnit/CI later.
- **Event Guard Utilities:** Spinner/combobox suppression patterns are documented for reuse in other complex panels.

## Next Steps
1. **Design `TransactionEditorViewModel` (Iteration 3):** Capture validation, split handling, and command routing for transaction entry screens.
2. **Extract Reusable UI Helpers:** Promote listener guards and selection-conversion helpers into shared utilities as the next panels migrate.
3. **Automate Regressions:** Evaluate wiring the manual tests into Gradle/JUnit so they run in CI, preventing regressions as ViewModels evolve.

## Conclusion

**Phases 1–3 of the MVVM refactor are complete.** The core infrastructure is in place, two major panels now rely on dedicated ViewModels, and manual regression suites cover both workflows. The architecture has proven repeatable, clearing the path for transaction entry and reporting screens to follow.

Next focus: design and extract `TransactionEditorViewModel`, applying the same separation-of-concerns playbook while pushing more shared utilities into the ViewModel layer.
